# 🛡️ Fraud Detection Project - Adey Innovations Inc.

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to build robust, interpretable machine learning models to detect fraudulent activities in e-commerce and banking transactions. The core objectives include:

* Enhancing fraud detection accuracy.
* Tackling class imbalance effectively.
* Engineering meaningful and insightful features.
* Maintaining a balance between security and user experience.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd fraud-detection-project
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### 🔧 Preprocess the Data

Run the preprocessing pipeline to clean, encode, scale, and balance your dataset:

```bash
python src/utils/preprocessor.py
```

* Inputs: `data/raw/Fraud_Data.csv`
* Outputs: `data/processed/processed_fraud_data.csv`
* Includes: datetime handling, SMOTE oversampling, encoding (with high-cardinality management), and scaling

---

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

Launch the EDA notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook src/notebooks/01_eda_fraud_data.ipynb
```

* Understand feature distributions, trends, and anomalies
* Engineer features like:

  * Time since signup/login
  * IP-to-country mapping
  * Device/browser indicators

---

### 🧠 Model Training *(Coming Soon)*

* Will include training with:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest
  * LightGBM
* Evaluation with:

  * AUC-PR
  * F1-score
* Explanation with:

  * SHAP (model interpretability)

---

## ✨ Key Features

* ✅ **Class Imbalance Handling:** SMOTE + undersampling
* 🔍 **Feature Engineering:** Time-based, geolocation, and behavior-derived features
* 🧱 **Modular Architecture:** Clean separation of code components
* 🧠 **Explainability-First:** SHAP integration for interpretability (planned)

---

## 📦 Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `imbalanced-learn`
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* `jupyter`

See full list in `requirements.txt`.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* High-cardinality columns (e.g., `user_id`, `ip_address`) are dropped to reduce memory usage.
* Avoid applying SMOTE on the test set to prevent data leakage.
* The modeling component is still under development.
