Sure! Here’s a clear, professional README.md draft tailored for your fraud detection project based on what you’ve done so far:

---

```markdown
# Fraud Detection Project - Adey Innovations Inc.

## Overview

This project focuses on building robust fraud detection models for e-commerce and banking transactions. The goal is to improve fraud detection accuracy while balancing security and user experience by handling imbalanced datasets, engineering meaningful features, and applying interpretable machine learning models.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd fraud-detection-project
````

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

### 1. Data Preprocessing

Run the preprocessing script to clean, encode, scale, and balance the dataset:

```bash
python src/utils/preprocessor.py
```

* This will load raw or intermediate processed data (`data/raw/Fraud_Data.csv` or `data/processed/processed_fraud_data.csv`), perform necessary transformations, handle class imbalance using SMOTE, and save the final preprocessed dataset in `data/processed/`.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering

Open and run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook src/notebooks/01_eda_fraud_data.ipynb
```

* Explore data distributions, perform feature engineering such as time-based features and geolocation mapping.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation

*(To be implemented)*

* A separate script will train Logistic Regression and ensemble models (Random Forest, LightGBM).
* Evaluate models using metrics suitable for imbalanced data (AUC-PR, F1-Score).
* Use SHAP for model explainability.

---

## Key Features

* **Handling Class Imbalance:** Uses SMOTE oversampling to balance fraud and non-fraud transactions.
* **Feature Engineering:** Time-based features (hour of day, day of week, time since signup), geolocation features via IP address mapping.
* **Modular and Reusable Code:** Clear separation between preprocessing, EDA, and modeling.
* **Explainable AI:** Future implementation of SHAP for interpretable predictions.

---

## Dependencies

* Python 3.8+
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* imbalanced-learn
* matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization in notebooks)
* Jupyter Notebook

See `requirements.txt` for full list.
